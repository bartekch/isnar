Segregation measures could have methods for mixing matrices.

Creating mixing matrices from any two vertex attributes.

R CMD check complains about a call to 'from' in E()[from()]. 'from' is not
visible as a function.

Consider computing the expected mixing matrix for assort and gamix using
poisson GLM.
