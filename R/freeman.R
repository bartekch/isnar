#' Generalized Freeman's segregation index
#'
#' Calculate Freeman's segregation index for undirected netoworks with
#' arbitrary number of groups.
#'
#' Freeman's segregation index (Freeman, 1978) is designed to capture the
#' extent to which the defined groups of vertices tend to have more edges with
#' vertices from the same group than with other groups.  Formally, the index
#' compares the observed number of between-group ties with the number of
#' between-group ties that would be expected if ties would be created randomly.
#'
#' The index has some discontinuity as there are network and group configurations
#' that are characterized by the higher number of between-group ties that is
#' expected under a random graph. The index is truncates these situations and
#' takes a value of 0.
#'
#' The original Freeman's formulation was for only two types of vertices.  Here
#' it is extended to the arbitrary number of types. The modification only
#' affects the way in which the expected number of inter-type edges under pure
#' random graph is calculated.
#'
#' The function internally calculates the frequency of types of vertices in the
#' supplied attributer \code{vattr}. However, it is possible to override this
#' by specifying ``true'' type distribution with the \code{dis} argument. It is
#' assumed to be a table (as returned by \code{table}) or a numeric vector with
#' frequencies of types of vertices. This may be especially usefull when
#' dealing with large graphs with larger number of isolates.

#' @param object R object, see Details for available methods

#' @param ... other arguments passed to/from other methods
#'
#' @return 
#' The value of the Freeman's index.
#'
#' If \code{more} is \code{TRUE}, some intermediate results are returned in a
#' list.
